# metaMIR 

metaMIR is a microRNA (miRNA) framework to predict interactions in human between miRNAs and clusters of genes. The user provides a set of genes to be targeted, and optionally genes not to be targeted. Taking data from a reference database of previously established predictive algorithms, metaMIR will return miRNA candidates predicted to co-regulate genes among those entered by analyzing all possible subset combinations.
