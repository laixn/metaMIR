# this folder contains the source code for metaMIR
# this version of the code is suitable to run on the commandline, with arguments:
# inputfile - list of genes (HGNC format) to be analyzed
# mincomb - the minimum combination size to be considered when perfoming the combinatorial analysis (default 5)
# maxclust - the maximum number of genes to analyze simultaneously (default 15)
# Zthresh - the minimum score per miRNA:gene-cluster pair to consider (default 1.1)
# outpath - a user-specified output path, if desired (default creates a "Results" subfolder under the current folder)
#
# the main execution file is metaMIR.R
# support files which need to appear in the same directory are:
# metaMIR_analytical.R
# metaMIR_subs.R
# refnegpos.RData
# betafit_mv.RData
#
# the binary refnegpos.RData file can be freely downloaded from https://app.box.com/s/57gk0k5eo3z7rd7cz6q48kxouskcricq
