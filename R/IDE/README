# this folder contains the source code for metaMIR
# this version of the code is suitable to run in and IDE such as RStudio. Execution of the main file creates a function
# called batch_metaMIR taking the following arguments:
* inputfile - list of genes (HGNC format) to be analyzed
* mincomb - the minimum combination size to be considered when perfoming the combinatorial analysis (default 5)
* maxclust - the maximum number of genes to analyze simultaneously (default 15)
* Zthresh - the minimum score per miRNA:gene-cluster pair to consider (default 1.1)
# 
# further description is contained in the main batch file
#
# support files which need to appear in the same directory are:
# metaMIR_analytical.R
# metaMIR_subs.R
# refnegpos.RData
# betafit_mv.RData
#
# the binary refnegpos.RData file is available for free download from http://www.bioinf.uni-freiburg.de/Software/metaMIR/miRNA_predictions.tar.gz
